                        I’ve worked with Jane since 2019, and her financial advice
                        has helped me scale my spa business confidently. Her
                        planning and budgeting support was key to opening our
                        second branch two months ago. She’s sharp, reliable, and

                    I have several policies and a personal Pension Plan account
                    which I got through Jane as the Agent. She comes out as
                    trustworthy and transparent in her dealings and an
                    excellent communicator which is great in customer service. 
                    
                    She has also evolved from a purely Insurance Sales Agent to
                    a holistic Financial advisor tailoring solutions to customers

                        We have experienced a massive growth since last year.
                        This is our second year in the game and soo far we are
                        able to make sober decisions that is beneficial to all of us
                        both long and short term.
                        
                        We invited Jane Ndichu who is a financial advisor and she
                        laid down for us everything we needed for our second
                        year and henceforth. With the questionnaire that she
                        gives before her lesson, we can now be able to understand
                        where everyone comes from in terms of investment and
                        knowledge about money.
